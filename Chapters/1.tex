\section{Neutrino Physics Historical Overview}

\subsection{The $\beta$ Decay Problem}

Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by Becquerel. A few years later, in 1899, Rutherford classified radioactivity emissions into two types: $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Rutherford conjectured that the $\beta$ decay was a two-body decay. In such a case, the decay would be characterized by a nucleus A becoming a lighter nucleus B, with the emission of an electron, like the following:

\begin{equation}
	A \longrightarrow B + e^- .
\end{equation}

Consequently, the energies of the outgoing particles would be kinematically determined. 
Using conservation of energy and momentum, it is straightforward to conclude that this energy should be:

\begin{equation}
	E = \frac{m_A^2 - m_B^2 + m_e^2}{2m_A} c^2.
	\label{electron_max_energy} 
\end{equation}

Experiments conducted by Meitner and Han in 1911 demonstrated that the energy spectrum of the electron coming out of the $\beta$ decay was, in fact, not well-defined, as expected if it was two-body decay. The electron energy spectrum was continuous, having the maximum energy defined by the equation \ref{electron_max_energy}, which is shown in figure \ref{figure_the_beta_decay_spectrum_of_tritium} \cite{griffiths}.

		\label{figure_the_beta_decay_spectrum_of_tritium}	
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

In 1930, Pauli proposed that the $\beta$ decay was not a two-body decay, but a three-body decay. He predicted that the third particle proposed by him would be neutral and light. Pauli originally named it neutron. Later, with Chadwick's discovery of the neutron, Fermi changed the name of this predicted particle to neutrino. A few years later, in 1933, Pauli and Perrin proposed that neutrinos were massless \cite{griffiths}.

\subsection{The First Neutrino Measurement}
It was not until 1956 that Reines and Cowan experimentally discovered neutrinos. They conducted an experiment at the Savannah River nuclear reactor in South Carolina that consisted of a 200 liters tank of water and cadmium chloride, surrounded by 4,200 liters of liquid scintillator, seated near the nuclear reactor. If the neutrinos predicated by Pauli were real, they would be produced by the nuclear reaction inside the reactor, enter the detector, and possibly hit the protons of the water, making a positron and a neutron. This reaction is called inverse $\beta$ decay, and it is given as:

\begin{equation}
	\overline{\nu} + p^+ \longrightarrow n + e^+.
	\label{inverse_beta_decay_eq}
\end{equation}

The signature of the reaction is two photons, produced by the electron-positron annihilation, and, a few microseconds later, a few photons, produced by the neutron capture by the cadmium \cite{nobel_leptons}. They found evidence for this signature, confirming the existence of neutrinos \cite{cowan_reines}. 

\section{Different Types of Neutrinos}
In 1953, Konopinski and Mahmoud proposed the existence of a lepton number and the conservation of it, which could explain why specific reactions happen and others do not. As a convention, it was established that leptons would have a lepton number L = 1, that antileptons would have a lepton number L = $-$1, and that any other particle would have a lepton number L = 0. By this rule, an antineutrino should be produced in a $\beta$ decay. Although the rule explained why many theorized reactions were not observed, it did not explain a few cases. This led them to postulate the existence of a lepton number for each of the leptons. That is, a muon number, an electron number, and, years later, a tau number (shown in Table \ref{lepton_family}) \cite{Konopinski_Mahmoud}. 

\begin{table}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{cccc}
			\bottomrule
						& \textbf{Lepton number}	&	\textbf{Electron number}	&	\textbf{Muon number}\\
			\toprule
			Leptons			&		&		&	 \\
			$e^-$			&	1	&	1	&	0\\ 
			$\nu_e$			&	1	&	1	&	0\\
			$\mu^-$			&	1	&	0	&	1\\	
			$\nu_\mu$		&	1	&	0	&	1\\
			Antileptons		&		&		&	  \\
			$e^+$			&	$-$1	&	$-$1	&	0\\	
			$\overline{\nu_e}$	&	$-$1	&	$-$1	&	0\\
			$\mu^-$			&	$-$1	&	0	&	$-$1\\
			$\nu_\mu$		&	$-$1	&	0	&	$-$1\\
			\toprule
		\end{tabular}
		\caption[The lepton family]{{\textbf{The lepton family from 1962 to 1976}} \cite{griffiths}}
		\label{lepton_family}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

Lederman, Schwartz, and Steinberger tested this hypothesis in 1962 at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. Their experiment consisted of having a beam of charged pions produced in a particle accelerator called the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) and observing the neutrinos that accompanied the muons produced whenever the beam pions decayed. Hypothetically, if the lepton number is the same for muons and electrons, the following reactions are allowed and, consequently, should be observed: 

\begin{equation}
	\nu_{\mu} + n \longrightarrow p + e^-
	\label{lss_primeira}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\overline{\nu}_{\mu} + p \longrightarrow n + e^+
	\label{lss_segunda}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\nu_{\mu} + n \longrightarrow p + \mu^-
	\label{lss_terceira}
\end{equation}
 
\begin{equation}
	\overline{\nu}_{\mu} + p \longrightarrow n + \mu^+
	\label{lss_quarta}
\end{equation}

In the experiment, only the third and fourth reactions were observed, implying that the interaction of neutrinos produced with a muon can only produce other muons. That is, each lepton has a corresponding neutrino \cite{two_neutrinos}.

\subsection{The Solar Neutrinos Flux Problem}
The series of nuclear reactions occurring in the solar and stellar cores are given by the so-called carbon–nitrogen–oxygen (CNO) cycle and the proton-proton (pp) chain. In the CNO cycle, four protons are successively absorbed in a series of nuclei, starting and ending with carbon. In the pp-chain two protons combine to form the deuteron and further protons are added \cite{the_story_of_the_neutrino}. In either case, the net process is:

\begin{equation}
	p+p+p+p \longrightarrow \textrm{He}^4 +e^+ + e^+ +\nu_e +\nu_e
	\label{solar_reaction}
\end{equation}

Ray Davis proposed an experiment to measure the neutrinos emitted by the sun. The experiment was based on the following inverse $\beta$ decay.

\begin{equation}
		\nu_e + \textrm{Cl}^{37} \longrightarrow e^- +\textrm{Ar}^{37}
		\label{solar_reaction-2}
\end{equation}

The idea was that the solar neutrino would interact with a chlorine atom, producing an electron and an Ar$^{37}$. A tank containing 615 tons of a fluid rich in chlorine, called tetrachloroethylene, was placed in the Homestake gold mine in South Dakota. The fluid was periodically purged with Helium gas to remove the Ar$^{37}$ atoms, which were then counted employing their radioactivity. On average, the experiment measured one neutrino every three days and ran for 30 years. Although the measurement of solar neutrinos was a success, the experiment measured a flux 2/3 smaller than the one theoretically predicted by Bahcall. This difference became known as the solar neutrino problem, and the results were published in 1970 \cite{the_story_of_the_neutrino}.

\subsection{Neutrino Oscillation}

In 1967 Pontecorvo published a paper called ``Neutrino Experiments and The Problem of Conservation of Leptonic Charge" in which he discussed the effect of neutrino oscillations on the solar neutrinos. He wrote \cite{pontecorvo_1967}: 
\begin{quote}
\emph{``From an observational point of view the ideal object is the sun. If the oscillation length is smaller than the radius of the sun region effectively producing neutrinos, direct oscillations will be smeared out and unobservable. The only effect on the earth’s surface would be that the flux of observable sun neutrinos must be two times smaller than the total (active and sterile) neutrino flux."}
\end{quote}

Thus, Pontecorvo anticipated the solar neutrino problem!

Over the years, many different neutrino oscillations models were proposed, and the scientists in the field still extrensivelly work on them. In the next session I will describe the current most accepted neutrino oscillations model. 

\subsection{Current Neutrino Oscillation Model}

The current model of oscillations considers three neutrinos: The electron neutrino, the muon neutrino and the tau.

In this model, a neutrino flavor eigenstate with momentum $\vec{p}$ can be written as a linear combination of the neutrino mass eigenstates:

\begin{equation}
	|\nu_\alpha \rangle = \sum_{k=1}^3 U^*_{\alpha k} |\nu_k \rangle,
	\label{nu_state}
\end{equation}
 
Where $\alpha$ is the corresponding lepton flavor ($e, \mu, \tau$), $|\nu_k\rangle$ is the eigenstates' base in which the neutrino propagates (also called mass base), $k$ is the mass states' index ($1, 2,$ or $3$) and $U$ is the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix \cite{MNS, PMNS}. The PMNS matrix is given by:
 
\begin{equation}
	U = \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 
	1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
	0 & c_{23} & s_{23} \\
	0 & -s_{23} & c_{23} \end{array} \right)
	%
	\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 
	c_{13} & 0 & s_{13}e^{-i\delta} \\ 
	0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
	-s_{13}e^{+i\delta} & 0 & c_{13} \end{array}\right)
	%
	\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
	c_{12} & s_{12} & 0 \\ 
	-s_{12} & c_{12} & 0 \\ 
	0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right)
	%
	\label{PMNS_factored}
\end{equation}
 
where $c_{ij} \equiv \cos(\theta_{ij}), \ s_{ij} \equiv \text{sin}(\theta_{ij})$ and $\delta$ is the Charge Parity (CP) symmetry violating phase parameter.
In equation \ref{PMNS_factored}, the three matrices represent different neutrino oscillation sectors, named after the context in which those parameters are measured. The left matrix represents the accelerator (or atmospheric) neutrino sector, the middle matrix represents the transition $\nu_e \rightarrow \nu_\tau$, that is present in both accelerator and reactor neutrino sectors, and the right matrix represents the reactor (or solar) neutrino sector.
 
Assuming that the flavor eigenstates are orthogonal, that the mass eigenstates are also orthogonal, that the PMNS matrix is unitary, that the neutrinos are oscillating in the vacuum, and also that the mass eigenstates are hamiltonian's eigenstates, we have that:

\begin{equation}
	H|\nu_k \rangle = E_k |\nu_k \rangle
	\label{nu_schrodinger}
\end{equation}
 
That means that the energy eigenvalues are
 
\begin{equation}
	E_k = \sqrt{\vec{p}^2 + m_k^2}.
	\label{nu_energy}
\end{equation}
 
If we evolve the mass eigenstate in time, it is possible to write the flavor eigenstate as
 
\begin{equation}
	|\nu_\alpha (t) \rangle = \sum_{k=1}^3 U^*_{\alpha k} e^{-iE_kt}|\nu_k \rangle.
	\label{nu_state_time}
\end{equation}
 
Rewriting equation \ref{nu_state_time} only in the flavor base yields 
 
\begin{equation}
	|\nu_\alpha (t)\rangle = \sum_{\beta = e, \mu, \tau} \left( \sum_{k=1}^3 U^*_{\alpha k} U_{\beta k} e^{-iE_kt} \right) |\nu_\beta \rangle.
	\label{nu_state_time_2}
\end{equation}
 
The term between parenthesis is the $\nu_\alpha \rightarrow \nu_\beta$ transition amplitude. With that information and some more algebra it is possible to show that the time dependent transition probability is
 
\begin{equation}
	P_{\nu_\alpha \rightarrow \nu_\beta}(t) = \sum_{k=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 U^*_{\alpha k} U_{\beta k} U_{\alpha j} U^*_{\beta j} e^{i(E_k - E_j)t}.
	\label{transition_probability}
\end{equation}
 
Some approximations and simplifications are possible. As neutrino masses are extremely small, they are in a relativistic regime. This allow the approximation, through Taylor expansion 
 
\begin{equation}
	E_k - E_j \approx \frac{m^2_k - m^2_j}{2E} = \frac{\Delta m^2_{kj}}{2E}.
	\label{nu_Ej-Ek}
\end{equation}
 
As the velocity of a neutrino is close to that of light in vacuum,
 
\begin{equation}
	L \approx ct = t.
	\label{nu_L}
\end{equation}
 
Separating the exponential in the equation \ref{transition_probability} into real and imaginary parts, the indexes in $k=j$ and $k>j$, and using some more algebra the final result is
 
\begin{eqnarray}
	P_{\nu_\alpha \rightarrow \nu_\beta} (L/E) & = & \delta_{\alpha\beta} - 4\sum_{k>j}^3  \mathfrak{Re}[U^*_{\alpha k} U_{\beta k} U_{\alpha j} U^*_{\beta j}]\text{ sin}^2\left(\frac{\Delta m^2_{kj} L}{4E} \right) \nonumber \\
	& \quad & + \ 2\sum_{k>j}^3\mathfrak{Im}[U^*_{\alpha k} U_{\beta k} U_{\alpha j} U^*_{\beta j}]\text{ sin}\left(\frac{\Delta m^2_{kj} L}{2E} \right).
	\label{nu_oscillation_final}
\end{eqnarray}
 

In figure \ref{fig:nu_osc_prob}, you will find a plot for the three flavor oscillation probabilities as a function of $L/E_{\nu}$, assuming the original state is $\nu_{\mu}$

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}

		\caption[Three Flavor Oscillation Model]{\textbf{Three Flavor Oscillation Probabilities as a Function of L/E$_{\nu}$} \\Three Flavor Oscillation Probabilities as a Function of L/E$_{\nu}$, assuming the original state is $\nu_{\mu}$ \cite{Lauren_thesis}.}
		\label{fig:nu_osc_prob}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
 
For the antineutrinos, the mathematical steps are similar from the ones we just took \cite{oscillation_math}. 
 
As it becomes clear from the equation above, neutrinos can only oscillate in-between flavors under the assumption they have a nonzero mass. Therefore, the first neutrino oscillation measurement completely changed our views on neutrinos and their place within the standard model. 

\subsubsection{First Neutrino Oscillation Measurements}
The first oscillation measurements, and consequently the confirmation that neutrinos have mass, were made by the Super-Kamiokande experiment. The Super-Kamiokande detector is located 1 km underground in the Kamioka-mine, Japan. It consists of a stainless-steel tank filled with 50,000 tons of ultra-pure water. It has about 13,000 photomultipliers installed on the tank's wall (as shown in figure \ref{superk_picture}). Their first oscillation measurements were published in 1998 \cite{first_kamioka_measure}.

\section{Current Understanding of Neutrino Physics}
At this point, let me briefly summarize the understanding we currently have of neutrinos, obtained through the experiments and studies I mentioned above and many other experiments I left out from this historical overview. 

Neutrinos are chargeless leptons with small non-zero mass that only interact through the weak force. So far, we know of the existence of three types of them, that we call "flavor", and that are named after the charged lepton that accompanies them in charged-current weak interactions: electron neutrino ($\nu_e$), muon neutrino ($\nu_{\mu}$), and tau neutrino ($\nu_{\tau}$). 

Three bosons mediate the weak interaction: The $Z^{0}$, responsible for Neutral Current (NC) interactions; and the $W^{-}$ and $W^{+}$, responsible for Charged Current (CC) interactions, with both cases being represented by the Feynman diagrams in figure \ref{feymann_diag}. A CC neutrino-nucleus interaction changes the type of the quark it interacted with and produces its respective charged lepton, conserving lepton number and charge, i.e., an electron neutrino will always produce an electron. In NC neutrino-nucleus interactions, the incoming neutrino transfers momentum to the nucleus, with no charged lepton or hadron production.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{Figures/feymann_diag.jpg}
		\caption[Feynman diagrams for the two types of weak interactions]{ {\textbf{Feymann Diagrams for the two types of weak interactions}} \\ On the left, the Feymman diagram for a Charged Current interaction, carried by a W boson. On the right, the Feymman diagram for a Neutral Current interaction, carried by a Z boson \cite{Lauren_thesis}.}
		\label{feymann_diag}	
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

We can observe different outcome products from neutrino interactions, depending on the energy of the incoming neutrino. At lower energies, $\lessapprox 10$ GeV, the dominant processes will be quasi-elastic scattering (QE), where neutrinos scatter off, and ejects out, a single nucleon. For interaction energies above 1232 MeV (the $\Delta$ baryon mass) resonance becomes energetically allowed, and this becomes the dominant process up to $4$ GeV. In it, neutrinos scatter off of a nucleon that gets excited. The deexcitation of the nucleon leads to a pion and a nucleon emission. From $4$ GeV beyond, the dominant process is Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS), where neutrinos scatter directly off of nucleus' quarks, producing multiple hadrons in the final state. In figure \ref{nu_nucleus_int} you can see an illustration of each of these interactions and its final products. In figure \ref{nu_scatter}, you can see a summary of the existing measurements of CC neutrino cross-section divided by neutrino energy and plotted as a function of energy.

It is shown which part of the energy spectrum can be explored by which experiment \cite{nu_scatter}.}

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The CP Symmetry Violating Phase Parameter}

The $\delta$ parameter showed in the PMNS matrix in equation \ref{PMNS_factored} quantifies the charge conjugation and parity symmetry violation. The strong and electromagnetic interactions are invariant under CP symmetry, but some weak interaction processes are not. This violating phase parameter is also observed in the quark sector and was already measured. The CP symmetry violating phase parameter is still not observed in the lepton sector. 

The existence of CP symmetry violation is the hypothesis to explain why we have an asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the universe. We know the CP symmetry violation observed in the quark sector is not enough to explain it. Quantifying it in the lepton sector is essential to test this hypothesis \cite{cp_violation}. Among the current and future experiments aiming to measure the CP symmetry violating phase is the NuMI Off-axis $\nu_e$ Appearance (NO$\nu$A) \cite{NOVA}, the Tokai to Kamioka (T2K) \cite{T2K}, and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) \cite{dune_snowmass_22}, to name a few.

\subsubsection{The Character of the Neutrino Mass Spectrum (Mass Hierarchy)}

The equation \ref{nu_oscillation_final} limits that the data of neutrino oscillation experiments can only measure the mass-squared differences. Due to the tremendous growth of the neutrino experiment efforts in the past two decades, it is known that \cite{delta_2_1, delta_3_2}

\begin{equation}
	\Delta m^2_{21} = (7.53 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{-5} \ \text{eV}^2
	\label{delta_21}
\end{equation}

and 

\begin{equation}
	\Delta m^2_{32} = (2.34 \pm 0.09) \times 10^{-3} \ \text{eV}^2
	\label{delta_32_normal}
\end{equation}

or 

\begin{equation}
	\Delta m^2_{32} = (-2.37^{+0.07}_{-0.11}) \times 10^{-3} \ \text{eV}^2.
	\label{delta_32_inverted}
\end{equation}

The relative ordering $m_1 < m_2$ is known through observations of solar neutrinos, which are subject to resonant matter effects in the sun \cite{delta_2_1}. The value in Equation \ref{delta_32_normal} corresponds to what is called Normal Hierarchy and in Equation \ref{delta_32_inverted} to what is called Inverted Hierarchy. Normal hierarchy is the condition where the $m_1 < m_2 < m_3$. Inverted hierarchy is the condition where the $m_3 < m_1 < m_2$. You may find a schematic of the normal and inverted hierarchies in figure \ref{mass_hierarchy}. The precision of neutrino sector measurements has reached a point where the unknown hierarchy is a major hurdle to further progress \cite{prospects_patterson}.

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/mass_hierarchy.pdf}

		\label{mass_hierarchy}	
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The $\mathbf{\theta_{23}}$ Octant Definition Problem}

The $\theta_{23}$ parameter is present is both $P_{\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\mu}$ and $P_{\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e}$ calculations. Most of the past neutrino experiments take advantage of an approximation that considers the existence of only two neutrino flavors due to limitations in their resolution. In this approximation the oscillation probabilities take the form of

\begin{equation}
	P_{\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e} \propto \text{sin}^2(2\theta_{23}) \ \text{ and } \ P_{\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\mu} \propto \text{sin}^2(2\theta_{23}),
	\nonumber
\end{equation}

which implies a redundancy in the value of $\theta_{23}$, with the possibilities being either $\theta_{23} > \pi/4$ or $\theta_{23} < \pi/4$. 
In more recent results, experiments such as NO$\nu$A, Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search (MINOS), and T2K, do not use this approximation, resulting in a 2-fold degeneracy solution for the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$. The latest results were presented by the NO$\nu$A Collaboration and can be seen in figure \ref{nova_result}, which shows the two best-fit values with their 90\% confidence level contours. In this study, NO$\nu$A Collaboration disfavored the maximal mixing ($sin^2 \theta_{23} = 0.5$) scenario with $2.6 \sigma$ significance \cite{NOVA}.

\end{figure} 

\subsubsection{Short Baseline Neutrino Anomalies}

Over the past few decades, some neutrino experiments found inconsistencies between their expected un-oscillated neutrino flux at low energies and their measurements. Allow me to describe a few of them briefly. The Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center published a paper in 2001 where they found an excess of electron-like antineutrino events in a primarily $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ beam \cite{lsnd}. Years later, the Mini Booster Neutrino Experiment (MiniBooNE) probed the same $L/E_{\nu}$ region and also found an excess of electron-like neutrino and antineutrino events in a primarily $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ respectively, depending of the polarity of the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB). Due to limitations on MiniBooNE's detector technology to separate electron and photon showers, their analysis was inconclusive as to whether the excess was due to new physics or background mis-modeling \cite{miniboone}. To address this issue, a new detector with better technology for particle identification was placed near MiniBooNE. This new experiment, named Micro Booster Neutrino Experiment (MicroBooNE), published its results in 2021. In this new report, they did not find an excess of electron-like neutrino events, but could not refute MiniBooNE's excess either \cite{microboone_lee}. 

The favorite hypothesis for new physics that could explain these anomalies is that a fourth neutrino would exist, called sterile neutrino ($\nu_s$). This neutrino, unlike the others, would not interact through any forces of the standard model (therefore ``sterile") and would only be indirectly observed whenever oscillating from or to one of the other flavors, which would justify those observations \cite{Lauren_thesis}. 
The short baseline neutrino anomalies and the existence of $\nu_s$s remain open questions in the field. 

\subsubsection{Majorana or Dirac Particles?}

In 1957, Goldhaber, Grodzins, and Sunya ran an experiment at the Brooke Haven National Laboratory to determine neutrinos' helicity. Helicity is a quantity in physics that encompasses the relative orientations of spin and linear momentum. If the projection of the spin onto the direction of momentum is a positive number, we call the particle ``right-handed". If the projection of the spin onto the direction of momentum is a negative number, we call the particle ``left-handed".
The results of the experiment, reported in the paper \cite{helicity}, indicated that all neutrinos are left-handed and all antineutrinos are right-handed. So far, we haven't had any evidence of left-handed antineutrinos or right-handed neutrinos. 
If neutrinos and antineutrinos and inherently different particles, like Goldhaber's \textit{et al.} experiment suggest, they are called ``Dirac particles". 
However, since neutrinos have mass, the helicity may be dependent on the reference frame in which the particle is observed. Theoretically, it is always possible to move to a reference frame in which the helicity would be flipped, and it is possible that neutrinos and antineutrinos are the same particles, just with different helicity. If that is the case, and neutrinos and antineutrinos are the same particles, they are called ``Majorana" particles. 
We currently have several experiments exploring this question, such as The Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO) experiment \cite{exo}, KamLAND-Zen \cite{KamLAND-Zen}, and The GERmanium Detector Array (GERDA) \cite{gerda}.
